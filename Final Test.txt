Greetings earthling,

This is the final test of PyText3 for this semester!

I have accomplished most of the things my checklist so I am prepared 
to hand in this project as is if I have to. The only things on my checklist 
that I haven't done are the advanced features that I will add if I keep
working on this project next year. This includes stuff like syntax 
highlighting, tabs, and code autocomplete.

Here is a list of all of the current features of PyText3
    - Editable text field
    - Cut, Copy, Paste, Select All, Undo, Redo
    - Menu Bar
    - File Management
    - Line Numbers
    - Themes & Fonts
    - Updating Status Bar
    - Find & Replace
    - Language Switching

PyText3 is now a fully funcional basic text editor. I am very happy with
the way that it has turned out and am excited to keep adding features and
performance improvements in my next semester of computers!

Kaleb R.
