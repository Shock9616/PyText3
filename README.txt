PyText3 is a code editor that was written entirely in Python 3
and includes support for C++, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Python,
Swift, and plain text files.

--------------
   Features
--------------
PyText3 currently supports editing all of the file types listed
above. It also includes line numbers, themes, and all of the
basic features of any code editor such as file management and
cut, copy, and paste.

-------------------
   Compatibility
-------------------
PyText3 is compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows as long as
there is a Python 3 interperter installed on the computer. There
is also a standalone .app file for macOS that will work even
without a python interpreter, and a windows .exe installer file
that will install an exe and all of its required files. Most of
the features will work with a vanilla install of Python 3 but a
few of them will require installation of 3rd party modules. If
these modules are not installed, the features will simply not work,
but the rest of the editor will still work just fine.

------------------
   Dependancies
------------------
 - Python 3
 - Pygments (For syntax highlighting)

 PyText3 also be run on macOS and Windows without a python interpreter
 using the respective applications for each OS.

------------------------
   Running the Editor
------------------------
To run PyText3, all you have do do is run the main.py file.


OR

Run the .app file on macOS located in the "dist" folder.

OR

Use the windows installer to get a standalone exe with all of the
required files in the same directory. The generated exe will not
run unless it stays in the same directory as all of the files but
does not require the python interpreter to work. The installer exe
is also located in the "dist" folder.
