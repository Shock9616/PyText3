# PyText3

PyText3 is a code editor that was written entirely in Python 3 and includes support for C++, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Python, Swift, and plain text files.

## Motivation

I created PyText3 as a project for my high school senior computers class

## Features

PyText3 currently supports editing all of the file types listed above. It also includes line numbers, themes, and all of the basic features of any code editor such as file management and cut, copy, and paste.

## Compatibility

PyText3 is compatible with Mac OS, Linux, and Windows as long as there is a Python 3 interperter installed on the computer. Most of the features will work with a vanilla install of Python 3 but a few of them will require installation of 3rd party modules. If these modules are not installed, the features will simply not work, but the rest of the editor will still work just fine.

## Dependancies
 - Python 3
 - Pygments (For syntax highlighting)

## Running the editor
To run PyText3, all you have to do is run the main.py file.
